📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
This project demonstrates how to clean, explore, and visualize data in order to extract meaningful insights before applying advanced models.

✨ Key Features

Importing and understanding raw datasets

Handling missing values and duplicates

Generating summary statistics

Visualizing data distributions and relationships

Detecting outliers

Identifying correlations between features

Presenting insights for decision-making

📂 Repository Structure

📖 Workflow

Data Loading
Inspect dataset shape, data types, and first few rows

Data Cleaning
Handle missing values, inconsistent entries, and duplicates

Univariate Analysis
Study distributions of individual variables

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
Explore relationships between two or more features

Visualization
Use plots such as histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmaps

Outlier Detection
Identify and evaluate anomalies in the data

Insights
Highlight key findings and recommendations

📊 Example Visuals

Histograms to understand feature distribution

Boxplots to detect outliers

Scatter plots to study relationships between variables

Heatmaps to show correlations

🧠 Applications

Preparing datasets for machine learning models

Guiding business decisions with insights

Understanding customer or market behavior

Supporting feature engineering
